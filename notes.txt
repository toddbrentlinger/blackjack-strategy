Strategy Order:

    If only 2 cards AND 2 cards are equal (including 2 Aces)
        Check Split Strategy section for Action
    
    If reach here, more than 2 cards OR 2 different cards

    If at least 1 Ace
        Sum up remaining cards (other Aces are 1)
        Check Ace Strategy section for Action using sum

    Check Base Strategy section


How to structure actual strategy?

- Different rules will have different strategies
- Card count can even change strategies
    - Too advanced for now. Stick to basic strategies.

- Actions:
H: Hit
S: Stand
P: Split
D/H: Double Down if possible, else Hit
D/S: Double Down if possible, else Stand
P/H: Split if Double Down after Split possible, else Hit
R/H: Surrender if possible, else Hit

- *Using 2D array with Action as value
    - Faster but more memory
    - Need to separately account for two equal cards for split possibilities, and Ace in hand possibilities

- Using loops and conditions to check for each possible Action
    - Less memory but slower
